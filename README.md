Meet Time: Mondays, 4:30-8pm, Senior CS Lab

CPSC09 ECDID
Description
Concrete has been delivered to millions of locations using paper tickets. Once the concrete is
delivered, there is no way to determine the exact location of the concrete that was delivered. For
quality control purposes, it is important to know the location of the tested material, particularly if
the material fails long term testing such as strength in structural members of pavements. The goal
of the project is to develop a cloud based data system that could become the complete quality
control record for the concrete project.

Concrete has been delivered to millions of locations using paper tickets. Once the concrete is

quality control purposes, it is important to know the location of the tested material, particularly if
the material fails long term testing such as strength in structural members of pavements.
The goal of the project can be broken down into several aspects. 1) To locate or develop an
RFID or other technology device that could be programmed and batched in to the concrete that
can be found at a later date if the location of the concrete batch is needed. (Electrical Engineering
Students)

2) To develop the device that would program multiple ECDID chips and dispense them into the
concrete mixer or delivery unit while simultaneousl upload the information to a cloud based
database. (Mechanical Engineering Students)

3) To develop a cloud based database interface that would allow project personnel to determine
what information they want to receive by text or email such as batch time, approximate delivery
time, batch information, and possibly allow entry of project data such as air content slump, unit
weight, temperature, etc. In essence, the cloud based data base could become the complete
quality control record for the project. This will require Soft Ware development, a CPSC Data
Management system and an RFID Reader Programmer. (Computer Science Students)
The CPSC students would be needed to write code to program the device along with code to
easily access information from the device. CPSC students would also need to review code from
multiple concrete batch systems. ACME Concrete Paving, Inc. operates a REXCON system in
four portable batch plants. The computer ouput must be analyzed and possibly modified to put
into a format that can be stored on the ECDID. We believe our realtionship REXCON will allow
us access to code to streamline this process.

We believe electrical engineeering students would be necessary to work on the project to identify
the proper RFID chip for use or determine if a different chip that would be programmable and be
able to be identified in a load of concrete with it, be a mixer truck, dump truck, or harden
placement. Electrical engineering students must also verify power requirements and help with
how information can be sent and retrieved from the ECDID.

Mechanical Engineering students will be needed to develop the system to store, program, and
distribute the ECDED to the concrete during the batch cycle. Give the difficult environment
where concrete is batched, the system must be very resistant to dust, dirt, water, vibration, and so
on.
A cost analysis of the device per cubic yard of concrete produced must be performed early in the
project to determine the cost per cubic yard of material produced. Discussion with industry
quality control individuals should also be performed under a non-disclosure agreement to
determine all the inforamtion that they would like to see in the ECDID.

# Deliverables:
• Working Prototype
• User Manual
• Proof of Concept
• Research
• Website Development
• App

CPM Schedule should be developed for the project along with a work breakdown structure that
would interface the various computer science and engineering disciplines on the project. We
would be will to meet with the project teams weekly if required
