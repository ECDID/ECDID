As part of this research, I completed tutorials for Amazaon RDBMS, and was able to set up a server by which to conduct SQL operations.

# Cloud Based Databases
- A Database that runs on a cloud computing platform
	- Underlying software is transparent to the user.
	- High availability, high scalability
	- Two Primary Methods storing your Database in the Cloud
		- Virtual Machine Image
			- Allows users to ‘rent’ virtual machine instances.
		- Database-as-a-Service
			- Enterprise-level companies take the work off of the consumer, all installation an maintenance is taken care of.
			- Amazon Relational Database Service, Microsoft Azure SQL.

# Amazon Relational Database Service
- Offers database hosting connected to a variety of database types (mySQL, etc.)
- Costs a lot, $12.00/mo for the most basic of database hosting services up to $15,000/mo for the ‘enterprise edition’.

I was able to easily set up a database hosted by Amazon, which seamlessly connects to a mySQL application. 
Many of the further tutorials are locked behind pay-walls as modules for a tutorial site QuikLabs. Once 
connected, it acts much as a regular SQL database, with the capacity to write Insert, Select, etc. statements. 

# MySQL vs MariaDB
- MariaDB is an offshoot of MySQL, run by former devs of SQL. 
- Created to avoid acquisition by Oracle.
- MariaDB is seemingly recognized by the database community as the ‘better’ of the two.
- More Transparent, better performance.
